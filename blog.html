  <h2>The Godfather</h2>
  <span class="blogAuthor"> By <strong> Kumar </strong></span>
   <p>If I think about all-time greatest movies, the first name which strikes my mind is The Godfather.
     The Mario Puzo film which is directed by Francis Ford Coppola has all the perfect aspect which any
     movie maker could ever imagine. The father-son relationship is the main essence of the movie which is
     beautifully depicted by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. It’s not just some mafia / crime family related concept
     but tries to explain how different scenarios in one’s life can change the entire future of the family. The
     thrill and the unpredictable twists make the movie really interesting till the end. The final thing which I
      would like to say about this movie is that, if anyone would start watching the first part of the movie, you
      will not feel the completeness till you finish watching all the three parts of this series. Overall, the movie
      and the series pack a perfect punch for all the viewers which would set a benchmark for rest of the movies across
       the world. In one word my review would be ‘Legendary’.</p>

  <h2>American History X</h2>
  <span class="blogAuthor"> By <strong> Priyanka</strong></span>
   <p>American History X is a 1998 drama about violence, racism, and neo-Nazism. It’s a moving
   picture about neo-Nazi skinhead Derek Vinyard, played by Edward Norton (of Fight Club fame) who
   brutally murders two black teens after trying to steal his car. Once released from prison, Derek
   emerges a changed man who struggles to help his younger brother from falling into the same trap he did.
   The film does a fantastic job highlighting Derek’s struggles with a lifetime full of prejudice and hate.
    Although his former acts were inexplicable, you almost sympathize with the internal struggles Vinyard goes
    through as he fights to become a better person. Each time I complete the movie I sit back and reflect on who
     I am today and what life would be like if I grew up in a similar setting. I think about how far our nation
      has come from our former, darker years. And, I think about how much more progress we have to work towards.
       American History X is a fantastic movie and I highly recommend all that haven’t seen it to give it a chance!

  <h2>Mad Max Fury Road 2015</h2>
  <span class="blogAuthor"> By <strong> Nikitha Peddolla</strong></span>
   <p>BANG BOOM BLASTS! This movie was probably one of the most action packed movies I have seen
   in some time. Before I get into the movie details an interesting fact about the way this was filmed.
   The movie is filmed in such a way that every single scene focuses on the center of the screen so the
   entire time all important action was always in your radius of attention in the center, which also is
    where you see the most clearly. The movie was of a post-apocalyptic world where there was an evil ruler
    who was manipulating people to exploit them and eventually a group of people overcome many obstacles to
    overthrow him. It was an entertaining movie that I enjoyed for a good time pass action packed movie. Yet
     it was typical, and predictable movie that did not stir and excitement for me.

  <h2>The Harry Potter</h2>
  <span class="blogAuthor"> By <strong> Sushma</strong></span>
   <p>The Harry Potter movie series is an enticing set of movies for all ages alike.
    Mostly adapted from the books written by J.K. Rowling, the movies depict the rise of a young
     wizard in a world filled with powerful sorcerers, imaginary creatures and puissant magic.
     While the movies match the books to the last word, changes have been made to suit the wide range
      of viewership these movies draw. Due to the PG-13 ratings of the movies, certain content has
      been removed to adapt the movie for the younger audience. Each movie focuses on the educational
      experience of Harry Potter, a young orphaned wizard who spends nearly 7 to 8 years at the Hogwarts
       School of Witchcraft and Wizardry learning new tricks, making new friends and enemies alike,
        and mostly trying to fight back Voldemort, the most powerful antagonist of the series. The movies
         have drawn a huge fan following to the books, where the audience are visualize the stupendous events
          occurring as the young wizard grows into a powerful sorcerer.
